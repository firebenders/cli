# Dead Simple Analytics Tool For Large Number of Conversations

Ask a question like "Where is my AI tutor struggling?", then we process conversations and provide a list of grouped answers by similarity like "AI tutor does not provide visual representation" or "AI tutor gives incorrect information".

## Getting Started

1. Get python 3.6 and pip
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `python main.py --csv sample100.csv --question "why is the student having a difficult time learning from the teacher" --output firstAnalysis.csv`
4. Open the `firstAnalysis.csv` to see the results. Open `sample100.csv` to see original raw conversations
